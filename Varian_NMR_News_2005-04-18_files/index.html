IMPORTING BINARY VnmrJ / VNMR FIDS INTO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE:

  Occasionally we receive inquiries about problems with importing VNMR / VnmrJ
data into third party software, sometimes claiming that we have altered the
FID format without proper notice or documentation. The editor thought that
this is worth a clarification.
  The key to importing VNMR / VnmrJ FIDs is that in order to determine the
format and the structure of the data importing software should look at the
BINARY FID file ("*.fid/fid"), NOT at the parameter file ("*.fid/procpar"),
even though the access to the latter (an ASCII file) may appear to be more
straightforward. Detailed information on the Varian data format is found in
chapter 5 "Parameters and Data" of the User Programming Manual - the article
below describes the key features of the binary Varian FID format.
  Why should importing software not look at VnmrJ / VNMR parameter, but rather
focus on decoding the binary FID file? There are several issues:
 - The Varian parameter file ("*.fid/procpar") primarily describes how a data
   set was acquired NOT how it is saved on disk: e.g., the parameter "dp" may
   be set to "'y'", indicating an acquisition with "double precision" (32-bit)
   word length; however, a user may then decide to save that FID (particularly
   in the case of large nD FIDs) as single-precision (16-bit) data by applying
   "compressfid". In this case, the parameter set will still contain "dp='y'",
   indicating how the data were acquired - but in apparent disagreement with
   the actual data format.
 - There are certain parameter settings such as "fsq='y'" (UNITY INOVA) or
   "dsp='i'" (any system) that currently cause FIDs to be saved in 32-bit
   floating point format - and there may be other post-acquisition processing
   steps that also cause a conversion to floating point format (e.g., "add"
   and "sub", possibly user-written functions) - WITHOUT annotation in the
   parameter set. We are NOT sloppy in our "parameter bookkeeping" - such
   annotation is NOT NEEDED, as the FID format is COMPLETELY and ACCURATELY
   documented inside the binary data file itself, see also the article below.
 - There have been cases where nD and arrayed experiments were aborted by the
   user, or through a hard- or software failure of some kind, and where the
   parameter "celem" was not updated (see bug "celem.6101"), possibly leaving
   a disagreement between the parameter set and the number of blocks in the
   actual FID data.
The conclusion: to determine the data structure and type clearly it is far
safer for importing software to look at the binary data file and its headers
(see the article below), rather than trying to extract this information from
the parameter file.
  The parameter file ("*.fid/procpar") of course is still required for data
importing, as it contains all relevant information about the experimental
conditions and the variables controlling the pulse sequence. A comprehensive
discussion of the format of the VnmrJ / VNMR parameter files is also found in
chapter 5 ("Parameters and Data") of the User Programming Manual.
                                                 [ Varian NMR News 2005-04-18 ]

VnmrJ / VNMR FID DATA FORMAT:

  With very minor exceptions (which are irrelevant in the context of data
importing) we have NOT changed the binary data format since the introduction
of VNMR almost 20 years ago, and this data format is described exhaustively in
section 5 "Parameters and Data" of the User Programming Manual. For FIDs, the
key is that FID files have a 32-byte data header with the following
structure:
        struct fileHeader
        {
          long nblocks, ntraces, np, ebytes, tbytes, bbytes;
          short vers_id, status;
          long nblockheaders;
        };
where the elements are defined as follows:
 - "nblocks" is the number of data blocks in the file,
 - "ntraces" is the number of (FID) "traces" per block (high resolution
   spectra with "nf=1" have one FID / "trace" per block, multi-echo FIDs such
   as imaging FIDs acquired in "compressed" mode may have multiple FIDs /
   "traces" per block),
 - "np" is the number of (real, not complex) points per "trace" (typically
   equal to the "np" parameter),
 - "ebytes" is the number of bytes per "element" (2 for 16-bit data, 4 for
   32-bit data),
 - "tbytes" is the number of bytes per "trace", i.e.,
        fheader.ebytes * fheader.np
 - "bbytes" is the number of bytes per block, i.e., in "C speak":
        fheader.ebytes * fheader.np * fheader.ntraces +
          sizeof(struct blockHeader)
   ("struct blockHeader" is discussed below).
 - "vers_id" may be used for the VnmrJ version ID (you may find this set to
   zero - it's not really used in our software);
 - "status" indicates the status of the data; the value of "status" is a flag
   field similar to the protection bits in the VNMR parameter definition:
     - bit 0  (0x1) indicates the presence of data
     - bit 1  (0x2) would indicate "spectrum" (as opposed to "FID")
     - bit 2  (0x4) indicates 32-bit (as opposed to 16-bit) data
     - bit 3  (0x8) indicates (32-bit, IEEE format) floating point data (in
                    which case the value of bit 2 is irrelevant)
     - bit 4 (0x10) indicates complex (as opposed to real) data
     - bit 5 (0x20) indicates hypercomplex data (transformed nD data only)
     - bit 6 (0x40) is unused up to VnmrJ 1.1D
   for the other bit fields see the User Programming Manual. In a typical
   VnmrJ 1.1D FID you may find the "status" field to have a value of 0x15,
   i.e., 0x1 (data present) + 0x4 (32-bit, i.e., "dp='y'") + 0x10 (complex)
 - "nblockheaders" is the number of block headers (always 1 for FIDs)
The block header that follows has a size of 28 bytes and is defined as
        struct blockHeader
        {
          short scale, status, index, mode;
          long ctcount;
          float lpval, rpval, lvl, tlt;
        };
Where the elements have the following meaning:
 - "scale" is the number of downscaling operations (non-circular, bit-wise
   right-shifts, or divisions by 2) while accumulating data (particularly when
   acquiring with a very large "nt" and "dp='n'") in the given block (see the
   article "How Does the Autogain Work?" in Varian NMR News 1999-09-11);
 - "status" in FIDs is usually the same as in the file header, see above;
 - "ctcount" is the value of "ct" for the associated FID block;
 - "lvl" and "tlt" are used to store the d.c. offsets (as determined via the
   noise sampling prior to acquisition) in channels A and B in the case of
   "nt=1", see Varian NMR News 2001-02-02.
For explanation on the other fields see the User Programming Manual.
  The first block header is followed by the first data block, and each of the
subsequent data blocks is preceded by its own block header (or the number of
block headers in special cases of processed nD data, as indicated in the file
header). In ALL cases - and most certainly in the case of FIDs - the structure
of the binary data (FID) file, i.e.,
 - the number of blocks,
 - the number of traces (FIDs / echoes) per block,
 - the number of "elements" (numbers) per trace (FID), and
 - the format of an element (32-bit IEEE floating point vs. 32-bit integer vs.
   16-bit integer)
is COMPLETELY and ACCURATELY described in the data headers. The byte order is
the one used with the Motorola MC68xxx, the Motorola PowerPC (PPC) and Sun's
SPARC family of processors, even if the data were acquired using VnmrJ_LX on
a system with an Intel / Linux based PC as spectrometer host, see Varian NMR
News 2005-01-22.

SECURITY HINT - NEW SUN SECURITY ALERTS:

  Sun's Alert Weekly Summary Reports reported several Solaris issues and
vulnerabilities - here are those which we believe might affect you as well:
 =&gt; Sun Alert ID 43904 (updated / resolved): During NFS Timeouts, a Solaris
    System may Panic While Using NFS Over TCP. The issue is resolved through
    the following patches:
        Solaris 2.6:    106639-08 or later
        Solaris 7:      108451-07 or later
        Solaris 8:      108901-08 (108528-29) or later
        Solaris 9:      114231-02 (113278-09) or later
 =&gt; Sun Alert ID 57736 (updated): In Very Rare Cases, "pkgrm" May Erroneously
    Delete Files and Directories Shared by Other Packages, Including
    Directories That are Vital to the Running of the System. The following
    workarounds should be applied before applying "pkgrm":
        Solaris 7:      back out patch 107443-23 and re-install 107443-22
        Solaris 8:      back out patch 110934-21 and re-install 110934-20
        Solaris 9:      back out patch 113713-18 and re-install 113713-17
    A final solution (new patches) for this issue is in preparation.
For more information on these issues and for links to the relevant patches see
the SunSolve Web site at
        <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/">http://SunSolve.sun.com</a>
You can also download and install the current Solaris patch cluster from
        <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/patches/">http://SunSolve.sun.com/patches/</a>

SECURITY HINT - PCA PATCHING AND SUN'S WEEKLY PATCH ALERT:

  The latest Sun Alert Weekly Summary Report announced a bad patch and asked
Solaris users to remove that bad patch and to reinstall the previous patch
version until a fixed new version of the bad patch becomes available. Now, if
you have been using PCA (Patch Check Advanced, see Varian NMR News 2005-03-14
and articles referred to therein) to perform automatic weekly or daily patch
updates, you may notice that PCA ADDS missing patches whenever it finds newer
patches that aren't installed yet - but does NOT remove bad patches, so is
this week's alert a reason NOT to use PCA? Or what do you need to do?
  The key point is: PCA is still OK, but it is worthwhile keeping an eye on
Sun's patch alerts, too! The following recipe assumes you are working with
Solaris 9, but equivalent procedures can be used for other Solaris releases;
the relevant alert note (alert ID 57736) states "back out patch 113713-18 and
re-install 113713-17". Here is what you need to do in the current case and
under Solaris 9:
 - become root, and type "showrev -p | grep 113713". You will find that PCA
   installed patch 113713-18, and most likely you will see that the previous
   version 113713-17 is also listed as installed (superseded by the bad one).
 - back out the bad patch with
        patchrm 113713-18
 - verify with "showrev -p | grep 113713" that the recommended predecessor
   version 113713-17 is present - if necessary, you can download that patch
   from Sun's Patch Web site at
        <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/patches/">http://SunSolve.sun.com/patches/</a>
   and install it separately, using "patchadd" (following the recipe given in
   the README file "README.113713-17" inside the patch directory).
 - to prevent that PCA reinstalls the bad patch again, add a line
        113713-18
   (this time WITH the version number) to the file "pca.ignore" in your PCA
   directory, see Varian NMR News 2005-02-19. If the patch is listed WITH the
   version-ID (i.e., 113713-18 rather than just 113713), PCA will still
   install 113713-19 or any later versions as soon as they become available.

Keyword:        acqmeter ++                       Bug-ID: acqmeter.6101
Short summary:  Does not update at defined rate
Full summary:   The "acqmeter" default update is 5 seconds which is a bit slow
                for some purposes (e.g., response of system to decoupling) but
                which works. The rate can be changed by examining "properties".
                Although the acqmeter appears to take these changes and begins
                to reel data out at a different rate, the data are not updated
                by the console and so "acqmeter" does not reflect what is
                happening. However, when "acqi" is connected then the update
                to "acqmeter" occurs properly.

Keyword:        acqmeter ###                      Bug-ID: acqmeter.6104
Short summary:  Time scale and filing options missing
Full summary:   It would be very useful to be able to have "acqmeter" display
                a time scale with absolute (maybe optionally also relative)
                timestamps. Also, a file/logging option would be useful for
                longer term observation, such as to observe field recovery
                after a lN2 or lHe refill.

Keyword:        convertbru ++                     Bug-ID: convertbru.j1101
Short summary:  Missing from distribution for MacOS X
Full summary:   "bin/convertbru" is missing from the software distribution for
                MacOS X - this does not allow us to import spectra from other
                manufacturers.

Bad versions:   VnmrJ 1.1D / MacOS X
Fixed version:
Reported by:    Stefano Ciurli, Bologna University
Date:           2005-04-04
Confirmed by:   Rolf Kyburz, Varian
Workaround:     If you have access to the VNMR 6.1C source code kit, transfer
                the module "src/bin/convertbru.c" to the Mac (assuming you
                have "Xcode" loaded), fix the bug "convertbru.6102" and
                recompile the module with
                        cc -O -o /vnmr/bin/convertbru convertbru.c
                Ignore the compiler warning: the resulting executable works
                just fine.

Keyword:        acqmeter ++                       Bug-ID: acqmeter.j1101
Short summary:  History chart doesn't have "acqmeter" features
Full summary:   The history chart of temperature, lock and spin provides only
                a very rough estimate of the spectrometer history compared to
                the "acqmeter" command - which isn't available under Linux
                (and even "acqmeter" didn't have all desired functions). Time
                steps, ticks/grids for both time and value axes, min/max
                values and file logging should be the minimum options
                selectable.

Short summary:  Entries with only one experiment give only one study
Full summary:   Trying to import a file such as
                        SAMPLE# USER    EXPLIST     SOLVENT TEST
                        1       Walkup  Proton      CDCl3   testing

                results in only one study instead of three. If the Proton at
                the protocol field is replaced with e.g. Proton-Carbon then it
                works OK. The origin may be related to "csvimport.j1103".

Keyword:        findxmlmenu ++                    Bug-ID: findxmlmenu.j1101
Short summary:  Wrong menu shown if local "owner" parameter exists
Full summary:   If a local "owner" parameter exists (and is not set to be the
                same as the UNIX account owner) in the current experiment,
                VnmrJ shows the wrong top menu because the macro "findxmlmenu"
                looks in the wrong place. There is a global "owner" parameter
                set to the UNIX owner, which shows the correct menus if a
                local "owner" parameter does not exist.

Confirmed by:   Bayard Fetler, Varian
Workaround:     Set "owner='your_login_name'", exit VnmrJ and restart. To fix
                this in all experiments, add the following lines at the end of
                "/vnmr/maclib/fixpar":
                        exists('owner','parameter'):$e
                        if ($e&gt;0.5) then destroy('owner') endif
                Then exit from VnmrJ and run "makeuser" in a shell window. Or,
                run "fixpar" in each workspace (exp1, exp2, etc.).

Keyword:        Locator ###/++                    Bug-ID: locator.j1158
Short summary:  Should mark "active" and "queued" experiments
Full summary:   To get more independent of the text output panel, it would
                help if the Locator would mark, in its "workspace mode", the
                experiment currently running and especially all experiments in
                a queue. One can see the former in the "Acquisition Status"
                window, but not the latter. This could be done e.g. with a
                text background in the same coloring scheme as used for walkup
                automation and sample changers.

Keyword:        svf                               Bug-ID: svf.j1102
Short summary:  May fail on very large file systems
Full summary:   When trying to save an FID on a very large (1.6 TBytes) disk
                partition (NFS-mounted from a Linux-based server), "svf"
                aborts with the error message
                        svf: problem saving text in test.fid: disk is full
                while "cp" onto the same file system (which is only 6% full)
                works without problems, and "mount" / "df" / "exportfs -v" (on
                the Linux server) show no anomalies that would explain the
                above behavior. It looks like VnmrJ is NOT "large file aware"
                and fails even though the files it is trying to write are NOT
                large at all! This was verified by saving data onto a smaller
                partition on the same NFS server, exported and mounted with
                the same options: this works without problems.
